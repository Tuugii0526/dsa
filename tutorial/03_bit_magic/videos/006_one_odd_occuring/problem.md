In this video we take on the challange of finding a number that occurs odd number of times in a given array of Integers. We have two approaches to accomplish our goal:

1. Naive Approach : Count the number of occurences for all numbers through a nested loop.

2. Efficient Approach : Use of bitwise XOR operator
